# Live Chat created using React + Firebase 

## Just login using your Google Account to test it:
https://chat-firebase-test.vercel.app/

To run, type on terminal:

### `npm i`
and
### `npm start`

I've used Firebase to store data (messages) and its authetication methods.    
Further on I can add other login methods such as Facebook / Email / etc.
